shadow (1:4.0.15-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * commands passed in argument to su must use su's -c option and must quote
    the command if it contains a space, as in:
        su - root -c "ls -l /"
    The following commands won't work anymore:
        su - root -c ls -l /
        su - root "ls -l /"
        su - root ls -l /

  * passwd does not support the -f, -s, and -g options anymore. You should use
    the chfn, chsh and gpasswd utilities instead.
  * login now distributes the nologin utility, which can be used as a shell
    to politely refuse a login

  CLOSE_SESSIONS and other variables are not used anymore in
  /etc/login/defs.
  As shadow utilities which use this file now warn about unknown
  entries there, administrators should remove such unknown entries.
  The supplied login.defs file does not include them anymore.

  dpasswd is no more distributed by upstream. Login do not support
  dialup password anymore.  Re-introducing this functionality in
  upstream is not trivial.
