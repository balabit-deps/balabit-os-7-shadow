      the last changed field gets set to 0, which tells login that the

      it's still not clear whether the newly built "login" package for
      Hurd is functional).

    - passwd only saves first 8 chars...duh :) closes: #33368
    - userdel can only do so much, the admin should know to check some
      things on their own, closes: #35418
    - Lot's of Y2K issues fixed in this release, closes: #37232
    - useradd requires the -m option to make it create a home directory
      if one does not exist, closes: #39581
    - useradd's -p option requires the password to already be encrypted
      as documented in useradd(8), closes: #39870, #39874

  %%- su (no longer a package, but has bugs just the same, will be
      forwarded to the login package soon)
    - Sorry, but su (all su's) invoke the shell with -c "cmd". This is
      documented, not a bug, it's a standard interface that su expects,
      go fix sash's bug for not supporting it, closes: #14551
    - Acknoledged NMU: closes: #20058
    - More "Fixed" bugs getting closed...CLOSED AT LAST, closes: #17593

  * Switched to a new build setup (dbs)
  * Split makes into seperate files to make it a little cleaner
  * FHS compliance changes (usr/{doc,man} to usr/share/{doc,man})
  * debian/tar.c: removed
  * su: su is now going to be provided by shadow's login package and
    removed from shellutils (the shellutils maintainer agreed to this)
    in preperation for future PAM support. Added conflicts with older
    version of shellutils that does provide the su binary.
  * debian/control.in: removed the secure-su package since login now
    contains su and all of it's components
  * debian/control.in: modified the package descriptions to be a little
    more explicative of what they do.
  * Upgraded standards version to 3.0.1.1
  * Setup suidmanager support for all +s apps, closes: #15705, #15704, #15699
  * Enabled PAM. Support now for su, passwd, chfn, chsh. I am working on the
    support in login.
  * expiry: Changed to be installed as sgid shadow instead of suid root
    since it doesn't need root priviledges. Also added man page expiry(1) based
    on the comments found in expiry.c.
  * Removed bashism's in control scripts. Now lintian clean (smells fresh too)
  * chage.c: Keep chage from locking when not running as root, since it just
    needs to read the shadow and password files. This let's it run sgid shadow
    instead of suid root. When run as root, it can lock files for editing.
  * login.c: Pam support Works For Me(tm)!
  * login.c: Fixed PAM's auth when PAM_USER was not set from the command line,
    also call pam_fail_delay() with FAIL_DELAY as the arg before authentication.
  * etc/login.defs.pam.linux: new file, reflects options that PAM takesover
  * etc/login.defs.pam.hurd: new file, same for Hurd
  * debian/passwd.mk: make sure that login.defs.5 get's installed for Hurd
  * pam.d/: Modified defaults for each service to reflect the old style and also
    added commented options on how to enable obsoleted options from login.defs
    in the PAM Way(tm).
  * debian/rules: removed --disable-desrpc from configure options since it was
    supposedly just a workaround for glibc 2.0
  * src/login.c: reset pam_fail_delay after every failure
  * debian/rules: remove debian/files on clean target
  * src/login.c: removed setup_limits() and check_nologin() usage when PAM is
    enabled
  * debian/login.pam.d,debian/login.defs.pam.linux: made notes about the pam_limits.so
    module, as well as pam_nologin.so
  * debian/su.pam.d: made notes about pam_limits.so module
  * debian/control.in: removed depends on libpam-motd since it is now in libpam-modules,
    also make login conflict with secure-su
  * debian/*: setup so that Hurd does not get PAM, since they don't have it ported
    completely yet.
  * debian/*: Final approach to a final upload, modified login.postinst to check old
    obsolete conffiles to see if the user needs a notice that they are no longer used.
